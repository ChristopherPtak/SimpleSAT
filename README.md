# SimpleSAT

_A simplistic boolean SAT solver_

## Description

The `simplesat` program is a boolean SAT solver. It takes a DIMACS-formatted
CNF file containing the problem to solve. The solver will attempt to find a
solution, and if one is found it will be printed in the DIMACS output format.

## Usage

`simplesat` takes an optional filename argument, or else it will read from
the console input. The flag `-o` can be used to redirect output to a file.

### Example

```
$ simplesat
 p cnf 2 3
 1  2 0
 1 -2 0
-1  2 0
